<p>
  CPP Are a series of projects to make the jump from C to C++ and dive into dive into Object-Oriented Programming.
</p>


## Key concepts:
<ul>
Every one of each 10 different small projects have a different new key concept to undertand, while making a transition from C to C++.
</ul>

## Programming concepts:
<ul>
  Each level adds new concepts.
  </ul>

## Technologies:
<ul>
  <li>C++</li>
  <li>GIT</li>
  <li>Makefile</li>
</ul>

## Skills:
<ul>
  <li>Rigor</li>
  <li>Imperative programming</li>
  <li>Object-oriented programming</li>
</ul>

## Soft skills:
<ul>
  Starting with a new languaje is never eassy. This project is an exercice both in practicing the repeating cicle of learning new skills and also applying everything that is transferable from the previous projects to accelerate and facilitate this new learning.
</ul>


## CPP0:
<ul>
  This first contact is about new concepts and differences between C and C++:
  <li>Namespaces</li>
  <li>Clases and instances</li>
  <li>Member variables and member functions</li>
  <li>List initialization</li>
  <li>Use of const and static</li> 
  <li>Comparisong between struct and class</li>
  </ul>

## CPP1:
<ul>
  This next project is about memmory ussage in C++:
  <li>Memory allocation (new and delete)</li>
  <li>References and pointers</li>
  <li>Variable lifetime and scope</li>
  <li>File stream handling</li>
  </ul>

## CPP2:
<ul>
  This project introduce us to standards on how should classes be implemented in C++:
  <li>Ad-hoc polymorphism and function overloading</li>
  <li>Operator Overloading</li>
  <li>Orthodoxal cannonical form</li>
  </ul>

## CPP3:
<ul>
  This exercice is all about inheritance:
  <li>Inheritance</li>
  <li>Acces specifiers</li>
  <li>Multiple inheritance and the diamond problem</li>
  </ul>

  ## CPP4:
<ul>
  In this one we dice into more complex inheritance probles and the use of keywords:
  <li>Subtype polymorphism</li>
  <li>Abstract classes and interfaces</li>
  <li>Use of keyword "virtual"</li>
  </ul>
